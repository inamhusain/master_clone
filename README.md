## Dependencies used in the project with their usage

1. [**retrofit**](https://pub.dev/packages/retrofit): A composable, cross-platform, Future-based API for making HTTP requests.
2. [**mobx**](https://pub.dev/packages/mobx): MobX is a state management library that makes it simple to connect the reactive data of your application with the UI.
3. [**flutter_mobx**](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_mobx): Provides the **Observer** widget that listens to observables and automatically rebuilds on changes.
4. [**provider**](https://pub.dev/packages/provider): A mixture between dependency injection (DI) and state management, built with widgets for widgets.
5. [**logger**](https://pub.dev/packages/logger): Small, easy to use, and extensible logger which prints beautiful logs.
6. [**flutter_svg**](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_svg): Draw SVG (and some Android VectorDrawable (XML)) files on a Flutter Widget.
7. [**flutter_gen**](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_gen): Used to reference the assets safely anywhere in the flutter app.
8. [**very_good_analysis**](https://pub.dev/packages/very_good_analysis): Linter rules corresponding to the guidelines in very good analysis.
9. [**intl**](https://pub.dev/packages/intl): Used for localization and other date-time utils
10. [**device_preview**](https://pub.dev/packages/device_preview): Approximate how your app looks and performs on another device.

## Architecture used

- [**MobX**](https://mobx.pub/) to manage the state of the widget with [**Provider**](https://pub.dev/packages/provider) to inject the dependencies of MobX stores to widgets.

## Git Hooks Configuration
*  Open **set-githooks.bash** file and Run it as highlighted in screenshot.

## Beta Testing

#### Android
We are using [App Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/appcenter/) for downloading the app for beta testing.

To checkout the beta versions of the application using App Center, you’ll need to receive an invitation email from the developer or get access to a public invitation link, and have a device that you can use to test.

#### iOS

We are using [TestFlight](https://developer.apple.com/testflight/) to download the app for beta testing.

To test beta versions of apps using TestFlight, you’ll need to receive an invitation email from the developer or get access to a public invitation link, and have a device that you can use to test.

**Internal testers** Members of the developer’s team in App Store Connect can participate as internal testers and will have access to all builds of the app.

**External testers** Anyone can participate as an external tester and will have access to builds that the developer makes available to them. A developer can invite you to test with an invitation email or a public invitation link. An Apple ID is not required. If you are part of the developer’s team in App Store Connect, you can be added as an external tester if you aren’t already an internal tester.

**Installing a Beta iOS App from an Invitation Email or Public Link**

1. Install [TestFlight]() on the iOS device that you’ll use for testing.
2. Open your invitation email or tap on the public link on your iOS device.
3. Tap View in TestFlight or Start Testing; or tap Accept, Install, or Update for the app you want to test.
